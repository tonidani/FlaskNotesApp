# FlaskNotesApp
Small Notes-webApp for trying to undestand the principles of cryptography. The notes are encrypted and appear as a hash in the database. They can be read only after logging in.
It was one of my very first projects using Flask. Now I would probably change a lot of things, but I like to go back to old projects to see where I made mistakes.
